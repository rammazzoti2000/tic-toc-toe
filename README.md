## Game Rules

  * This is a customized version of the original [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game. Tha basic rules remain unchanged, the tokens to play with have changed instead.

  * The game is played on a 3 by 3 grid
  ```
      1  |   2   |   3    
    ----------------------
      4  |   5   |   6    
    ----------------------
      7  |   8   |   9    
  ```

  * The tokens you will play with in this game version will be "rum" and "vodka". While the first player will have the option to choose from the given tokens, the second player will have the token automatically assigned.
  * Each player will take turns putting their assigned token in empty squares.
    ```
      Player 1 turn - "rum"

          rum  |   2   |   3  
        ----------------------
           4   |   5   |   6  
        ----------------------
           7   |   8   |   9  

      Player 2 turn - "vodka"

         rum  |   2   |   3  
        ----------------------
           4  |   5   |   6  
        ----------------------
        vodka |   8   |   9  
    ```
    * The first player to get 3 tokens in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.
    ```
        Winning combinations (W is either "rum" or "vodka").

          W | W | W    1 | 2 | 3     1 | 2 | 3     W | 2 | 3     1 | W | 3     1 | 2 | W     W | 2 | 3     1 | 2 | W 
         -----------  -----------   -----------  -----------    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------
          4 | 5 | 6    W | W | W     4 | 5 | 6     W | 5 | 6     4 | W | 6     4 | 5 | W     4 | W | 6     4 | W | 6 
         -----------  -----------   -----------  -----------    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------
          7 | 8 | 9    7 | 8 | 9     W | W | W     W | 8 | 9     7 | W | 9     7 | 8 | W     7 | 8 | W     W | 8 | 9 
    ```
    * When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends and nobody wins.

      ```
          rum  | vodka |  rum  
        ----------------------
          rum  | vodka | vodka 
        ----------------------
         vodka |  rum  |  rum  
      ```
